One of the more exciting mode is the 'battle' mode which you can play against a selection of our bots including one trained using Q-Learning and one using Genetic Algorithm. We even offer an 'active mode' where with the help of a Raspberry Pi and motion sensor, you can physically move the blocks by running around!"

### ARM11 Assembler and Emulator
*End of first year project*

- Built a 2-pass assembler for `ARM11` architecture, written in `C`
  - Supports the majority of the basic instructions in the instruction set
  - Compiles into binary format, executable on `QEMU` or equivalent emulator
- Designed and developed emulator for the same architecture
  - Also supports the same instruction set so to be compatible with the assembler above

### Tetris Plus Plus
*Tetrisssss!!!*

- Re-built the classic **Tetris** from scratch in C
  - GUI implemented on top of `ncurses` library
- Shipped with a bunch of extensions
  - 1v1 death mode - play against our own bots, trained via `Q-Learning` or `Genetic Algorithm`
  - Sports mode - move the pieces by moving around with motion sensors enabled
